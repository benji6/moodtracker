## About

MoodTracker is a free and open source web app app that aims to help you understand yourself better. Track your emotional landscape, keep a mood journal, time your meditations, keep a meditation log and gain new insights into yourself. It's simple to use, works offline and because it runs in your browser you can use it across all your devices!

The MoodTracker UI was built using a component library I made called [Eri](https://github.com/benji6/eri).

## Getting started

### Dependencies required on host machine

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version specified in [.nvmrc](/client/.nvmrc))
- [Python](https://www.python.org) (latest version 3.x)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (latest version 1.x)

### Install project dependencies

```sh
make init
```

### Run frontend locally

```sh
make start
```

### Test application locally

You will need to be running the client locally on the default port for the end-to-end tests to pass and you will need credentials for a registered user on the platform that you can use to set the `MOODTRACKER_TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `MOODTRACKER_TEST_USER_PASSWORD` environment variables.

```sh
make test
```

### Deploy

#### Backend and infrastructure

Majority of the infrastructure is managed with AWS CloudFormation (a few things that aren't well supported have been done manually).

```sh
make deploy
```

**N.B. making changes to the API doesn't trigger a new deployment, but you can trigger a manual deployment by copying the value of the `ApiGatewayDeployCommand` output and running that.**

#### UI

Continuously deployed with [Netlify](http://netlify.com).

##### N.B.

- Icons are stored in version control and are generated by running `npm run icons` in the `/client` dir.
