You can now [track your sleep](/sleep/add)!

Once you have recorded a few sleeps you will see new charts in [your stats pages](/stats) that show you the relationship between your mood and how much you sleep!

Hope you enjoy this new feature and it helps you to get the right amount of sleep each night! ðŸ˜Š
