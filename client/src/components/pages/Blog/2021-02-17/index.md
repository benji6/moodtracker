The Explore page has had some updates. There are now 4 charts on it and they all update to reflect the date range you select. You can take a look at your average mood over the hours of the day, or the days of the week for the time range you select. This should allow you to view your data in new ways and gain new insights.

We'd show you a screenshot but there are too many charts to display, so if you're signed in then go ahead and [check out the Explore page here](/stats/explore)!
