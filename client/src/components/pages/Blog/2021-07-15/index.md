Just a quick one to say that we've moved all your dedicated meditation stats to a single page. If you are logged in then you can check them out [here](/stats/meditation) (you may need to record a few meditations and a few moods before we have enough data to show you something meaningful).

This page will give you a rough indication of how meditating impacts your mood, including whether it raises it or lowers it and what sorts of moods you are likely to feel before and after.

We've found it quite interesting and insightful and we hope you do too!
