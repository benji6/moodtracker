Sometimes you want to record a mood that happened in the past instead of recording how you feel right now. Now you can! When you [add a mood](/moods/add) you can now optionally set the date it was experienced.

Thanks to MoodTracker users who requested this feature [on GitHub](https://github.com/benji6/moodtracker/issues/261)!

Enjoy!
