We've made a small addition to your stats pages. In addition to being able to examine weeks, months and years you can now drill down into individual days. Take a look at today's stats by clicking "Today" in the navigation menu. You can also drill down into individual days from the weekly stats view by clicking bars in the weekday bar chart, or you can drill down into individual days from the monthly stats view by clicking calendar days in the calendar visualization.

Hopefully this feature makes it easier for you to see what was going on for you on specific days.

Enjoy!
