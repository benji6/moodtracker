Once you are signed in you can now [track runs](/runs/add), [track push-ups](/push-ups/add), [track sit-ups](/sit-ups/add) and [track leg raises](/leg-raises/add)!

That's a lot of new things that can be tracked, so you also have the ability to [configure what you want to track](/settings/events).

Enjoy!
