        <h2>Business model</h2>
        <p>
          I started building MoodTracker in April 2020 because I couldn&apos;t
          find anything that worked in the way I wanted and because I enjoy
          making things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is currently free because there are very few active users,
          which means that it costs me very little to run. If this app gets very
          popular and starts costing a lot of money then I may explore revenue
          models, but that doesn&apos;t seem like it will happen any time soon,
          so for now I&apos;m very happy to share this experience for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope that those of you who are using it are enjoying it and finding
          it useful! üôÇ
