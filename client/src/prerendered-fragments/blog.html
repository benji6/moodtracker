Less exciting stuff like bugfixes, performance improvements and minor UI changes won&#x27;t get a mention here.</p></div><div class="e-paper"><article itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><h2>Average mood by hour<span class="e-sub-heading"><time dateTime="2021-02-19" itemProp="dateCreated datePublished pubdate">February 19, 2021</time></span></h2><div><p>You can now see your average mood by hour on the weekly, monthly and yearly statistics pages.</p>
<p><img src="/screenshot.210905b1.png" alt="Screenshot demonstrating the average mood by hour chart" title="Screenshot demonstrating the average mood by hour chart"></p>
<p>This can give you insights about how the time of day impacts your mood. For instance, there&#39;s clearly an afternoon dip in this chart. With MoodTracker you can run experiments and see the results, perhaps trying different foods for lunch or getting more sleep at night can change the way you feel throughout the course of the day. MoodTracker makes it easy to discover what works best for you!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re signed in then <a href="/stats">take a look at your stats here</a>.</p>
</div></article></div><div class="e-paper"><article itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><h2>Improvements to the explore page<span class="e-sub-heading"><time dateTime="2021-02-17" itemProp="dateCreated datePublished pubdate">February 17, 2021</time></span></h2><div><p>The Explore page has had some updates. There are now 4 charts on it and they all update to reflect the date range you select. You can take a look at your average mood over the hours of the day, or the days of the week for the time range you select. This should allow you to view your data in new ways and gain new insights.</p>
<p>We&#39;d show you a screenshot but there are too many charts to display, so if you&#39;re signed in then go ahead and <a href="/stats/explore">check out the Explore page here</a>!</p>
</div></article></div><div class="e-paper"><article itemscope="" itemType="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><h2>New feature - search and filter<span class="e-sub-heading"><time dateTime="2021-01-23" itemProp="dateCreated datePublished pubdate">January 23, 2021</time></span></h2><div><p>You can now search and filter through all your moods!</p>
<p><img src="/screenshot.6c64e0b3.png" alt="Screenshot demonstrating the new search feature" title="Screenshot demonstrating the new search feature"></p>
<p>This can lead to some interesting insights. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now review your best and worst moments.</li>
<li>You can search for different activities you&#39;ve logged in your explorations to see how they impact your mood (see the screenshot above). Filter through your hobbies and see what you most enjoy doing.</li>
<li>You can even take a look at how you rank your different emotions on average by filtering the description field.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are all sorts of possibilities here for exploring patterns in your emotional life.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to have a few moods logged before you can make use of this feature. When you have enough entries you&#39;ll see the search toggle and be able to get started on your <a href="/">homepage</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>First up we&#39;ve added a year page which allows you to review your mood over the course of an entire year. The most interesting new visualization is the day-by-day calendar view:</p>
<p><img src="/screenshot.b1ce93c4.png" alt="Screenshot demonstrating the whole year calendar view" title="Screenshot demonstrating the whole year calendar view"></p>
<p>We&#39;ve made a number of other tweaks and enhancements too, for instance it is much easier to navigate around your stats now. All views are linked so it is easy to drill down from year to month to week and to drill up from week to month to year.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy these new features and gain new insights from them!</p>
